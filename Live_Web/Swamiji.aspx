            <p class="lead">Vivekananda was born Narendranath Datta on 12 January 1863 in Calcutta in a wealthy family. In his early youth Narendra joined a Freemasons' lodge and a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshub Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore in the pursuit of finding the ultimate Truth. Ram Chandra (maternal uncle of Naren's mother) told Narendra — "If you really want to know the truth, why are you roaming about with Brahmo Samaj? You won't get success in your endeavours here, go to Ramakrishna Paramhansa at Dakshineswar.". The meetings with Ramakrishna proved to be a turning point in Narendra's life.[28] He started visiting Dakshineswar regularly.The meeting of Narendra and Sri Ramakrishna was an important event in the lives of both. A storm had been raging in Narendra's soul when he came to Sri Ramakrishna, who himself had passed through a similar struggle but was now firmly anchored in peace as a result of his intimate communion with the Godhead and his realization of Brahman as the immutable essence of all things. Narendra was attracted by Ramakrishna's personality but he initially could not recognize Ramakrishna. After his second day's experience considered him as a "Monomaniac". His thoughts had been shaped by the teachings of Brahmo Samaj, which were against "idol worship" and he was an atheist in real life. He tested Ramakrishna in various ways and asked him many critical questions.In 1884, when Narendra was preparing for his upcoming B.A. examinations, his father Vishwanath Datta died.[49] His father's sudden death left the family bankrupt; creditors began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home. Ramakrishna asked him to go to the idol of Kali and ask it himself. Following the suggestion, Narendra went to the temple of Kali in the night and stood in front of the idol. He bowed to goddess Kali but forgot to pray for wealth. He prayed for "wisdom, discrimination, renunciation and Her uninterrupted vision". After the death of Thakur he travelled the length and breadth of India anfd looking at the materialistic poverty of our country he realized that our country needed a materialistic support to awaken our peoples' sprirt from a deep slumber. This he planned to recieve from a newly developed nation America. He attended the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893. And the rest is history, continuing.....
