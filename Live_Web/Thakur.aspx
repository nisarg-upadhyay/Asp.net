He experienced His first ecstacy at the tender age of 6. At the age of 20 He assumed His duties as the head priest in the Kali temple of Dakshineshwar. After the He plunged into deep waters of spiritual austerities. For 30 long years He practised paths prescribed by various religions and different Hindu sects.

            <p class="lead"><b> First, we must raise the Hindu race, then the world. That is why Sri Ramakrishna was born. He never destroyed a single man's inclinations. He gave words of hope and encouragement even to the most degraded and uplifted them. We must follow in his footsteps and uplift everyone, and rouse them. Swamiji often qouted "My teacher, my master, my hero, my ideal, my God in life." Pointing out mistakes hurts a man's feelings. His disciples saw how often Sri Ramakrishna would encourage people who they thought were worthless and change the whole course of their lives! His method of teaching was phenomenal.Swamiji fought the Master for six years with the result that He knew every inch of the way! Every inch of the way!"Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to begin every day by walking about in his room for a couple of hours, saying 'Satchidânanda!' or 'Shivoham!' or some other holy word. Ramakrishna has no peer. Nowhere else in the world exists such unprecedented perfection, such wonderful kindness to all, such intense sympathy for men in bondage. He had the same sympathy for all; he had found the secret of  their  harmony.  A man ought to be intellectual, or devotional , or mystic, or  active; each of the various religions represents one or  the other of all these types.  Yet it is possible to combine all the  four in one man, and this is what humanity in the future is going to do. That was his idea.  He condemned none but saw the good in all. He was a triumphant example, a living realization of the  complete renunciation of lust and money.  He was far beyond any idea of either; and such a man was necessary for this  present age. Such renunciation is necessary in these days when men have begun to think that they cannot live even a  month without what they call their 'necessities,' while at the same time they are increasing in geometrical ratio.  It was   necessary in a time like this -  one man should arise to demonstrate to the skeptics of the world that he cared not a straw for all the gold and all the wealth that was in the universe.</b>
