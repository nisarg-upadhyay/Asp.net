            <p class="lead"><b>Shardamani was born in a simple pious brahmin family in Jayramvati village. Right from her childhood Her innate spiritual tendencies were much evident. Unlike other girls of her age she was very mature and inclined greatly to spirituality. At the age of 5 she was married to Sri Ramakrishan Paramhams this event gave a major push to her spirituality. Till she was 18 she remained at Jayramvati and Thakur was deep plunged in Sadhanas, after 18 when she went to Thakur's house to stay with Him, Thakur saw the presence of The Divine Mother in Her and He worshipped her as the Universal Mother. It is mentioned in the Shastsras that when a man worships his wife as a Goddess their spiritual bondage is the highest form of spirituality. Their bondage was so pious and pure that their marriage was never consummated, on the contrary this bond intensified the growth of both of their spirituality.</b>

            <p class="lead"><b>When a devotee said that he had the darshan of the Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, Swami Akhandananda, a disciple of Sri Ramakrishana remarked: ‘When you had the darshan of the Holy Mother, the same result of having the darshan of Sri Ramakrishna will accrue to you. To have had the darshan of the Mother or the Master is the same.One has to acknowledge the fact that those men and women who received the grace of the Holy Mother and Sri Ramakrishna could not do so without a lot of austerities in their previous lives. The pujaris perform imitation anna-kuia (distribution of rice in huge quantities); whereas how great is the anna-kuia of the real Mother of the universe, who is feeding all human beings and other jivas of the world! When one reflects on this, one does not quite know whether one’s mind moves away from the body. Sri Ramakrishna would sometimes say, this time Mahamaya Herself has come on a sojourn in human form. When all and sundry will flock around her, She will disappear. Know it for certain that when the Holy Mother has blessed you, from that very moment your fate is changed. Many people even now deeply regret that they could not have the darshan of the Mother. Only he can understand Sri Ramakrishna or the Holy Mother to whom they reveal themselves. The sun can be seen only with sunlight. It is by their grace and compassion that men can know them and have their darshan. If you can make the Mother your own, through Her grace you will attain everything. The Holy Mother was previously living in her human body. Now the other resides in the hearts of every son and daughter and all devotees. The more one will meditate on the Mother and Sri Ramakrishna, the more one will come to know of them. Those who have once talked or associated with them can never forget their love in life. Parents just do not know how to love like them.</b>
